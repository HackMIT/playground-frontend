If you need to test anything that involves communicating with [playground-backend](https://github.com/techx/playground), refer to the README in that repository to get that up and running.

### Recommended

I recommend you install the [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) and [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) VSCode extensions for easy development.
