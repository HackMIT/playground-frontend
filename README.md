# playground-frontend

The user-facing side of Hack Penguin 🐧

## Setup

Make sure you have yarn installed. If you don't have yarn installed, [click here](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install).

### Installation

```
yarn
```

### Get Started

```
yarn start
```

If you need to test anything that involves communicating with [playground-backend](https://github.com/techx/playground), refer to the README in that repository to get that up and running.

### Recommended

I recommend you install the [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) and [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) VSCode extensions for easy development.
