              Humanitarian AI is a meetup.com community with local groups in
              twelve cities. The community was started by former United Nations
              staff to give students and AI developers opportunities to
              interface with humanitarian organizations, discuss artificial
              intelligence applications and work on volunteer projects advancing
              the humanitarian AI field.

              UDP conducts community-centered, data-driven, applied research
              toward more equitable and inclusive futures for cities. Our
              research aims to understand and describe the nature of
              gentrification and displacement, and also to generate knowledge on
              how policy interventions and investment can respond and support
              more equitable development.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              The goal of UDP is to produce rigorous research and create tools
              to empower advocates and policymakers, to reframe conversations,
              and to train and inspire the next generation of leaders in
              equitable development.
